> Kubeaudit can now be used as both a command line tool (CLI) and as a Go package!

# kubeaudit :cloud: :lock: :muscle:

`kubeaudit` is a command line tool and a Go package to audit Kubernetes clusters for various
different security concerns, such as:
* run as non-root
* use a read-only root filesystem
* drop scary capabilities, don't add new ones
* don't run privileged
* and more!

**tldr. `kubeaudit` makes sure you deploy secure containers!**

## Package
To use kubeaudit as a Go package, see the [package docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit).

The rest of this README will focus on how to use kubeaudit as a command line tool.

## Installation
 
### Download a binary

Kubeaudit has official releases that are blessed and stable:
[Official releases](https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit/releases)

### DIY build

Master may have newer features than the stable releases. If you need a newer
feature not yet included in a release you can do the following to get
kubeaudit:

**For go 1.12 and higher:**
```sh
GO111MODULE=on go get -v github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit
```

**For older versions of go:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit.git
cd kubeaudit
make
make install
```

Start using `kubeaudit` with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) or view all the [supported  commands](#commands).

### Kubectl Plugin

Prerequisite: kubectl v1.12.0 or later

With kubectl v1.12.0 introducing [easy pluggability](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/) of external functions, kubeaudit can be invoked as `kubectl audit` by

- running `make plugin` and having `$GOPATH/bin` available in your path.

or

- renaming the binary to `kubectl-audit` and having it available in your path.

## Quick Start

kubeaudit has three modes:

1. Manifest mode
1. Local mode
1. Cluster mode

### Manifest Mode

If a Kubernetes manifest file is provided using the `-f/--manifest` flag, kubeaudit will audit the manifest file.

Example command:
```
kubeaudit all -f "/path/to/manifest.yml"
```

Example output:
```
$ kubeaudit all -f "internal/test/fixtures/all_resources/deployment-apps-v1.yml"

--------- Results for ---------------------

  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: deployment
    namespace: deployment-apps-v1

--------------------------------------------

-- [error] AppArmorAnnotationMissing
   Message: AppArmor annotation missing. The annotation 'container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/container' should be added.
   Metadata:
      Container: container
      MissingAnnotation: container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/container

-- [error] AutomountServiceAccountTokenTrueAndDefaultSA
   Message: Default service account with token mounted. automountServiceAccountToken should be set to 'false' or a non-default service account should be used.

-- [error] CapabilityNotDropped
   Message: Capability not dropped. Ideally, the capability drop list should include the single capability 'ALL' which drops all capabilities.
   Metadata:
      Container: container
      Capability: AUDIT_WRITE
...
```

#### Autofix

Manifest mode also supports autofixing all security issues using the `autofix` command:

```
kubeaudit autofix -f "/path/to/manifest.yml"
```

To write the fixed manifest to a new file instead of modifying the source file, use the `-o/--output` flag.

```
kubeaudit autofix -f "/path/to/manifest.yml" -o "/path/to/fixed"
```

### Local Mode

If a kubeconfig file is provided using the `-c/--kubeconfig` flag, kubeaudit will audit the resources specified in the kubeconfig file. If no kubeconfig file is specified, `$HOME/.kube/config` is used by default:

```
kubeaudit all -c "/path/to/config"
```

For more information on kubernetes config files, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/

### Cluster Mode

Kubeaudit can detect if it is running within a container in a cluster. If so, it will try to audit all Kubernetes resources in that cluster:
```
kubeaudit all
```

## Audit Results

Kubeaudit produces results with three levels of severity:

`Error`: A security issue
`Warning`: A best practice recommendation
`Info`: Informational, no action required. This includes results that are [overridden](#override-errors)

The minimum severity level can be set using the `--minSeverity/-m` flag. See [Global Flags](#global-flags) for a more detailed description.

## Configuration File

Kubeaudit can be used with a configuration file instead of flags. See the [all command](docs/all.md).

## Override Errors

Security issues can be ignored for specific containers or pods by adding override labels. This means the auditor will produce `info` results instead of `error` results and the audit result name will have `Allowed` appended to it. The labels are documented in each auditor's documentation, but the general format for auditors that support overrides is as follows:

An override label consists of a `key` and a `value`.

The `key` is a combination of the override type (container or pod) and an `override identifier` which is unique to each auditor (see the [docs](#auditors) for the specific auditor). The `key` can take one of two forms depending on the override type:

1. **Container overrides**, which override the auditor for that specific container, are formatted as follows:
```yaml
container.audit.kubernetes.io/[container name].[override identifier]
```
2. **Pod overrides**, which override the auditor for all containers within the pod, are formatted as follows:
```yaml
audit.kubernetes.io/pod.[override identifier]
```

If the `value` is set to a non-empty string, it will be displayed in the `info` result as the `OverrideReason`:
```
$ kubeaudit asat -f "auditors/asat/fixtures/service-account-token-true-allowed.yml"

--------- Results for ---------------------

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ReplicationController
  metadata:
    name: replicationcontroller
    namespace: service-account-token-true-allowed

--------------------------------------------

-- [info] AutomountServiceAccountTokenTrueAndDefaultSAAllowed
   Message: Audit result overridden: Default service account with token mounted. automountServiceAccountToken should be set to 'false' or a non-default service account should be used.
   Metadata:
      OverrideReason: SomeReason
```

As per Kubernetes spec, `value` must be 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between.

Multiple override labels (for multiple auditors) can be added to the same resource.

See the specific [auditor docs](#auditors) for the auditor you wish to override for examples.

To learn more about labels, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/

## CI/CD usage

kubeaudit will return exit code `2` whenever any errors are being found, so it can stop your pipeline.
If you do not want this to happen, run it as `kubeaudit all || true`
