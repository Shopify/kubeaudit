### Example with Custom Drop List

A custom drop list can be provided as a space-separated list of capabilities using the `-d/--drop` flag:

```
$ kubeaudit capabilities --drop "MAC_ADMIN AUDIT_WRITE" -f "auditors/capabilities/fixtures/capabilities_nil_v1beta2.yml"
ERRO[0000] Capability not dropped. Ideally, the capability drop list should include the single capability 'ALL' which drops all capabilities.  AuditResultName=CapabilityNotDropped Capability=MAC_ADMIN Container=fakeContainerSC
ERRO[0000] Capability not dropped. Ideally, the capability drop list should include the single capability 'ALL' which drops all capabilities.  AuditResultName=CapabilityNotDropped Capability=AUDIT_WRITE Container=fakeContainerSC
```

**Note**: if using http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html as a reference for capability names, drop the `CAP_` prefix.

## Explanation

Capabilities (specifically, Linux capabilities), are used for permission management in Linux. Some capabilities are enabled by default.

Ideally, all capabilities should be dropped:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myContainer
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - all
```

If capabiltiies are required, only those required capabilities should be added:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myContainer
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - all
            add:
            - AUDIT_WRITE
```

In this case, an override label needs to be added to tell kubeaudit that the capability was added on purpose. See [Override Errors](#override-errors).

To learn more about capabilities, see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html

To learn more about capabilities in Kubernetes, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-capabilities-for-a-container


## Override Errors

First, see the [Introduction to Override Errors](/README.md#override-errors).

The override identifier has the format `allow-capability-[capability]` which allows for each capability to be individually overridden. To turn a capability name into an override identifier do the following:
1. Lowercase the capability name
1. Replace underscores (`_`) with dashes (`-`)
1. Prepend `allow-capability-`

For example, the override identifier for the `AUDIT_WRITE` capability would be `allow-capability-audit-write`.

Container overrides have the form:
```yaml
container.audit.kubernetes.io/[container name].[override identifier]: ""
```

Pod overrides have the form:
```yaml
audit.kubernetes.io/pod.[override identifier]: ""
```

Example of a resource with `AUDIT_WRITE` and `DAC_OVERRIDE` capabilities overridden for a specific container:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        container.audit.kubernetes.io/myContainer.allow-capability-audit-write: ""
        container.audit.kubernetes.io/myContainer.allow-capability-dac-override: ""
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myContainer
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - all
            add:
            - AUDIT_WRITE
            - DAC_OVERRIDE
```

Example of a resource with `AUDIT_WRITE` and `DAC_OVERRIDE` capabilities overridden for a whole pod:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        audit.kubernetes.io/pod.allow-capability-audit-write: ""
        audit.kubernetes.io/pod.allow-capability-dac-override: ""
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myContainer
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - all
            add:
            - AUDIT_WRITE
            - DAC_OVERRIDE
```
